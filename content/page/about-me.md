Hello!

My name is Thomas Mullaly and I'm a Software Engineer. This is the reincarnation of my blog which used to be powered by (and hosted by) [Ghost](https://ghost.org). This new blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and runs in [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/). I'm pretty happy with the new set up and it's substantially less ðŸ’° than the old blog. I hope to have a blog post sometime soon detailing how I got this set up using App Engine.
