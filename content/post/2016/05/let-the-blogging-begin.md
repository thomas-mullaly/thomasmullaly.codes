Hello! Welcome to my blog.

I know I am fairly late to the blogging scene, but better late than never. My hope for this blog is to document my adventures in technology. My first series of posts will document how I setup this blog to run in Google Cloud's Container Engine, using Kubernetes, Docker, Ghost, MySQL, and NGINX. Stay tuned!
